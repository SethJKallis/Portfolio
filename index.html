            <h2>About me</h2>
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p> love listening to all types of music ranging from rock to RnB to Drill. I also enjoy gaming on PC. I have a steam library with more than 100 games. I play 5-a-side football every Sunday and watch anime when im not being active.</p><br>
            <h3>Aspirations</h3>
            <p>I aspire to become a Web Developer. My short-term goal is to become a frint-end web developer. I want to work as a front-end developer before transitioning into a back-end developer. Once I've become a back-end developer I would work for a few years before becoming a freelance Back-end, Front-end and/or Full Stack Developer. My long-term goal is to go into business for myself. I will start my own company and use what I learn in web development to eventually open my own practice. over the course of my training i will network and establish relationships with people who would willingly offload excess work to me, in which case I will truly become my own boss.</p>
